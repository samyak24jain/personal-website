# Samyak Rajesh Jain

## About Me

<p>
  üëã Hello! I'm Samyak, a Machine Learning Engineer with over 5 years of experience in Natural Language Processing (NLP), computer vision, and on-device ML. Currently pursuing my Master's in NLP at <a href="https://www.ucsc.edu/">UC Santa Cruz</a>, I'm passionate about bridging the gap between theoretical AI and real-world applications. üíº My journey in AI has taken me through innovative projects at Coherent and Samsung Research.
</p>
<p>
  üöÄ My current focus areas include:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Enhancing LLM reasoning with graph-structured plans (collaboration with Meta AI)</li>
  <li>Multimodal QA systems for technical data using LLMs and VLMs (with Bosch Research)</li>
  <li>Efficient on-device ML solutions</li>
</ul>
<p>
  ü§ù I'm always excited to collaborate on challenging AI projects. Let's connect and innovate together!
</p>
