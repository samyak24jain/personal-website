  #   description: In this project, we predict a FIFA player's position based on their skill levels, attributes and personal information. Our data is adopted from a Kaggle dataset and uploaded on github. We use the FIFA-19 data for training and FIFA-20 data for testing. We train multiple Multi Layer Perceptron models (simple artificial neural networks) with and without Regularization to understand the difference in performance. The Regularization techniques used are Early Stopping and Dropout Layer.
